This repository contains a Dockerfile with a common error and its solution. The original Dockerfile fails to build because the `COPY` instruction is referencing a `requirements.txt` file which does not exist in the build context or has an incorrect path. The corrected Dockerfile addresses this by ensuring that the `requirements.txt` is correctly copied and the paths are accurate.  This is a common mistake in Dockerfiles, highlighting the importance of carefully managing file paths and dependencies.
